Purpose

The purpose  of this set of this project is to create a webpage with a built in tool that can generate a password for the user, where the user gets to indicate a preferred length, as well as the use of numbers, symbols and letters.

How It Works

The user will first arrive at the website where they must press a button to generate a password. When the button is pressed, the user is prompted to choose the length of their password, from 8 to 128 characters. Next, the user must confirm or deny (cancel) to include the use of capital letters, numbers and symbols (special characters) in the password they want generated. A new random set of characters will be produced and printed in the message box, and will match the desired length chosen by the user before the new password is generated.
